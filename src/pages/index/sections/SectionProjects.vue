        </span>
        <div>
          <p>Friendsweb was a social network built from scratch in my own cms system. Users were able to sign up, create a profile
          with your details, a cover photo and a profile picture. They also could post statusupdates, upload pictures, send
          messages, form groups, create sites for e.g. companies. It even features a realtime chat system.</p>
          <p>From the technical viewpoint, i used a PHP 5.x backend with a MySQL Database. For the UI I built a UI Framework first,
          later switched to Bootstrap. As a JavaScript framework jQuery was used.</p>
          I developed it as a replacement for my first social network called NDS-NETZ, which was my first Project ever developed in
          2008</p>
          <p>At it's peak friendsweb was used by about 70 active members, by about 1000 media objects as photos and videos. I
          closed it in 2013 as I wanted to focus on other projects, while not a single one of them was finished.</p>

          These packages can be obtained by sharing via QR Coded. The Idea was that a user can collect special cards, by visiting special places in real live and scanning QR Codes there. Upon this System never took of, a pack shop was developed, but not yet released.
          Saufcorn is the only drinking game with a pink Unicorn and features a really childish humour, paired with a lot of girly pink and purple colors. It has about 400 downloads in Total on iOS and Android.</p>

          <p>2016 I talked to my coordinator at my university about this project. I wanted to build an app that could show you all the lectures a person had, what's server in the mensa for lunch, all the exam dates and you grades. After the university approved the concept, the app was realized as a students-project. We worked really hard, and had our first working prototype after 6 months.</p>
          <p>The App is based on ionic 3 and accesses the internal University API's via Rest. You can read more about this on the following links</p>
